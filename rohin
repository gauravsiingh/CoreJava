Hi,

Finally the moment has arrived to say goodbye, which is never easy; especially when I have been a part of the Bitwise family for more than 6 years. It has been a fantastic journey and a great learning experience where I have enjoyed every moment and I appreciate having had the opportunity to work with each of you with whom I have interacted.

Sincere thanks to entire DART team & my colleagues for their support and guidance to excel in my career.
It was pleasure knowing each & every one of you. 

I wish you all the very best and stay in touch.  

Below are few of the selected links which I came across and thought of sharing, it may be handy for any developer at any level to excel in their carrier.
